# 1121_SIMULATION-AND-STATISTICAL-COMPUTING-HW3

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.10
- matplotlib 3.7.1
- scipy 1.10.1
## Usage

### Using p and q and simulating 
the experiment results until it is a success.

1. Run `python Geometric Random Number Generator by Simulating.py`.
2. You can achieve the desired results by adjusting the `**samples_nums**` and `**p**` values. Modify these parameters to tailor the outcomes according to your requirements.

### Geometric Random Number Generator by Inverse Transform

1. Run `python Geometric Random Number Generator by invTransform.py`.
2. You can achieve the desired results by adjusting the `**samples_nums**` and `**p**` values. Modify these parameters to tailor the outcomes according to your requirements.

### Use X= Int(log(U)/log(q))+1 Generate Geometric Random Number

1. Run `python Geometric Random Number Generator Method 3.py`.
2. You can achieve the desired results by adjusting the `samples_nums` and `p` values. Modify these parameters to tailor the outcomes according to your requirements.
