# 1121_SIMULATION-AND-STATISTICAL-COMPUTING-HW6

## Overview

This program simulates the MM1 queue model, which involves Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. The program generates customer arrival times, service start times, service end times, and waiting times, and plots distribution graphs for this information.

## Contents

1. Execute the hw6.py file in your Python environment.

## Parameter Descriptions

* arrival_rate: Arrival rate, controlling the rate at which customers arrive.
* service_rate: Service rate, controlling the rate of service time.
* simutime: Number of simulations, used to generate results for multiple simulations.


## Requirements

- Python 3.10.10
- matplotlib 3.7.1
- numpy 1.24.2
