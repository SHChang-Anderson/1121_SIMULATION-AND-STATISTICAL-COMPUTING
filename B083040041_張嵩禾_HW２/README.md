# 1121_SIMULATION-AND-STATISTICAL-COMPUTING-HW2

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.10
- matplotlib 3.7.1
- scipy 1.10.1
## Usage

### Question 1

1. Run `python Simulation of Integration_by_montecarlo.py`.
2. The program will sampling according to a random normal distribution and averaging the results for different sample sizes, then multiplying by the interval width of 4, is used to estimate the integral result. The program will compare this estimate with the result calculated by the integration function in the Python SciPy library to observe the convergence of the estimation.
3. The program will display the estimated integral result after ten thousand simulations.

### Question 2

1. Run `python Estimate E[N] by generating x values of N.py`.
2. Input the simlulate times.
3. The program will Estimate E[N] by generating Input values of N.

`Run python Estimate E[N] by generating x values of N relative err.py` to obtain the differences between each estimation value and the expectation value estimated by the previous N, as well as the convergence plot.
