# 1121_SIMULATION-AND-STATISTICAL-COMPUTING-HW1

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.10
- matplotlib

## Usage

### Coin Tosses

1. Run `python Simulation of Coin Tosses.py`
2. Waiting for simulation: This program will simulate coin tosses from one toss to ten thousand tosses.
3. The program will display probability line charts for each toss, showing the probability of heads (or tails) occurring.

### Rolling Dice

1. Run `python Simulation of Rolling Dice.py`
2. Waiting for simulation: This program will simulate dice rolls from one roll to ten thousand rolls.
3. The program will display probability line charts for all the rolls, showing the probability of each points occurring.

### Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating π	

1. Run `python Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating π.py`
2. Waiting for simulation: This program will simulate the Monte Carlo estimation of the value of pi using points from point 1 to point 10,000.
3. This program will display the absolute error between the actual value of pi and the estimated value of pi for different numbers of points.
